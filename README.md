## [Questionary Usage](https://questionary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pages/types.html)

### Use questionary to ask a single question
```python
import questionary
question = questionary.text("What's your first name?")
```
### Need to prompt the user to answer it:
```python
answer = question.ask()
```
### You can concatonate creating and asking the question in a single line for simplicity:
```python
import questionary
answer = questionary.text("What's your first name?").ask()
```

## [Fire Usage](https://github.com/google/python-fire/commit/9f9630ac871138c04c8654eb46d66ca0a2f70b7c) 
You can call `Fire` on any Python object:<br>
functions, classes, modules, objects, dictionaries, lists, tuples, etc.

Here is a simple example from the fire-github.

```python
import fire
class Calculator(object):
  """A simple calculator class."""
  def double(self, number):
    return 2 * number
if __name__ == '__main__':
  fire.Fire(Calculator)
```

## [Tabulate Usage](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)

### Use tabulate to print small tables with just one function call. The formating is guided by the data itself.
```python
>>> from tabulate import tabulate

>>> table = [["Sun",696000,1989100000],["Earth",6371,5973.6],
...          ["Moon",1737,73.5],["Mars",3390,641.85]]
>>> print(tabulate(table))
-----  ------  -------------
Sun    696000     1.9891e+09
Earth    6371  5973.6
Moon     1737    73.5
Mars     3390   641.85
-----  ------  -------------
```
### Optional argument named `headers` will provide column headers:<br>
```python
>>> print(tabulate(table, headers=["Planet","R (km)", "mass (x 10^29 kg)"]))
Planet      R (km)    mass (x 10^29 kg)
--------  --------  -------------------
Sun         696000           1.9891e+09
Earth         6371        5973.6
Moon          1737          73.5
Mars          3390         641.85
```
